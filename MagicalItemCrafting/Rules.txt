Magical Item Crafting System

Core Requirements:

1. Allow users to combine two magical ingredients to create new items.
2. Each ingredient must have the following attributes:
    - Name (string)
    - Element (Fire, Ice, Earth, Air, Spirit)
    - Potency (integer value between 1 - 10)
    - Type (Crystal, Herb, Metal, or Essence)
    - Rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary)

3. Crafting should produce a result containing:
    - Name of the crafted item.
    - Quality score (decimal value between 0.0 - 1.0 / output as percentage)
    - Success / Failure status
    - Special Effect message

4. The crafting table should:
    - Have two slots for ingredients
    - Validate ingredient placement
    - Check compatibility
    - Calculate the resulting Quality
    - Generate appropriate result messages


Game Logic Rules:
1. Ingredient Compatibility Rules:
    - Combined Potency cannot exceed 20
    - Opposing Elements (Fire - Ice, Earth - Air) require both ingredients to have potency >= 8
    - Legendary ingredients cannot be paired with Common ingredients
    - Strong Potency (8 - 10) cannot be paired with Weak Potency (1 - 3)

2. Quality Calculations:
    - Base Quality = (ingredient1.Potency + ingredient2.Potency) / (2 * MaxPotency)
    -- We sum the potencies to get the total magical power
    -- We divide (2 * MaxPotency) because:
        > Two ingredients at max potency (10 + 10) / (2 * 10) = 1.0 (Perfect Quality)
        > Two ingredients at min potency (1 + 1) / (2 * 10) = 0.1 (Poor Quality)
        > Two average ingredients (5 + 5) / (2 * 10) = 0.5 (Medium Quality)

    Rarity Bonuses: 
        > Two Legendary: +0.5 
        > One Legendary: +0.3
        > Two Rare: +0.2
        > Same Rarity: +0.1

    - Final Quality capped at 1.0
    - Quality Determines:
        > Item Durability
        > Strength of Magical Effects
        > Market value
        > Crafting Experience gained

3. Crafting Result Rules:
    - Crystal + Herb = Potion
    - Metal + Crystal = Amulet
    - Herb + Essence = Elixir
    - Other Combinations = Mixture (Generic)

    Quality Tiers affect magical item power:
        <= 0.3: Poor
        <= 0.6: average
        <= 0.8: Good
        <= 0.9: Masterwork

4. Special Effects:
    - Same Elements: "Resonating Power" (Double the elemental effect strength)
    - Fire + Ice: "Thermal Shock" (Add damage over time)
    - Earth + Air: "Dusty Whirlwind" (Add area of attack component)
    - Any Spirit: "Spiritual Infusion" (Add duration boost)
    - Dominant Fire: "Burning" (Add fire damage component)
    - Dominant Ice: "Freezing" (Add show effect)
